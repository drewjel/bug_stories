This sensor-streaming application runs in some assumed 
world with 3-d geometry and time as physical dimensions. 
We import and will build from phys.geom and phys.time,
each of which comes with an uninterpreted "standard"
coordinate system.

We need to assume a physical interpretation of the data
that represents our world affine coordinate system. So
here's what we'll assume.

(1) ORIGIN: the world_geom_acs.origin represents the 
northwest-ish (back right) lower corner of the Rice Hall
Less Lab

(2) BASIS VECTORS
    basis0 
      - points right/east along the wall
      - unit length is 1m 
      - right handed chirality
    basis1 
      - points to the door along the west wall, 
      - unit length is 1m
      - RHC
    basis2 
      - points up along the NW corner of the room, 
      - unit length is one meter, 
      - RHC

  Note that world_geom_acs is not definitionally equal to
  geom3d_std_space because the latter uses fm.base as its
  frame, while world-geom_acs uses a frame defined by the
  fm.deriv constructor.

We're assuming a RealSense D435I hardware
unit. It comes with a defined coordinate
system
We'll assume that the camera_imu is two
meters to the right along the back wall,
one meter out from the wall and one meter
high. We'll inhert the standard vector 
space structure from the world_geom_acs.

That's its position in space. As for its
orientation, we'll assume that 

1. The positive x-axis points to the subject.
2. The positive y-axis points down.
3. The positive z-axis points forward

We will assume that the origin of the camera's affine coordinate system is the same as UTC,
so we're using the origin of UTC as the origin Camera's time frame.
